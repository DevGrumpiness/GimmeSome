## typescript

Never used typescript before? Don't worry! You will be fine. Actually you will love it. Everbody does!

## github coespaces

You can clone th project locally or just use the magic of github codespaces.
Codescpaces basically runs a container in the cloud and connects to you VSCode.

## prettier.rc and eslint

To make things easier I configured eslint and prettier.
I recommend turning on "format on save" in you editor and choose "Prettier Code Formatter" while working on this project.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
